Each may treat semi-colons a particular way, or require capitalization -- but they are sort of the same underneath all that.</p>\n<p>The reality of programming is much more complicated than that.</p>\n<h3>Programming Today</h3>\n<p>It's weird to think of, but most of the really \"big\" ideas in computer programming were developed in the 1950s and 60s. Many new languages have developed since then, but none of them represent a truly novel approach to logic and computation.</p>\n<p>The development of new programming languages in the last few decades has focused a lot on developer experience. This may mean trying to enable code that is easier to write (the driving force behind Ruby) or easier to read (Python), or making certain types of logical structures and modes of problem solving more intuitive.</p>\n<p>Some languages have been developed to solve particular problems in programming (<a href=\"/compare/php/\">PHP</a> and SASS, for example), to manipulate certain types of systems (<a href=\"/resources/sql/\">SQL</a>), or to run in a particular environment or platform (Java and JavaScript). A number of languages have been developed for the purpose of helping newcomers learn programming (BASIC and Scratch are classic examples).</p>\n<p>Since theories and practices around language design have (mostly) settled into a widely recognized orthodoxy, much of the new and interesting work in the development of programming practice currently centers around system architecture.</p>\n<p>Relatively recent development include concepts like SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) and MVC (Model-View-Controller), and <a href=\"/resources/ruby-on-rails/\">frameworks like Ruby on Rails</a> that enable programmers to easily work within these paradigms.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"resources-for-common-programming-languages\">List of Coding Languages</h2>\n<p>A growing list of popular programming langauges, markups and protocals.

The great challenge for early computing was figuring out how to mechanize logic and mathematical computation. Technological advancement &mdash; inventing new components and miniaturizing them &mdash; came much later. The first computer &mdash; Charles Babbage's difference engine &mdash; was made out of gears, and powered by a hand crank.</p>\n<p>But the problem with the difference engine is that it could only solve one kind of problem. In order to generalize the usefulness of this mechanical calculator, it needed to accept two kinds of input &mdash; data and programming. Babbage's theoretical new machine, the Inference Engine, solved that problem.</p>\n<p>Though Babbage's Inference Engine was never built in his lifetime, the very first computer program was written to be run on it. <a href=\"/resources/ada-lovelace/\">Ada of Lovelace</a>, a Countess and hobbyist mathematician, wrote programs for Babbage's computation device.</p>\n<h3 id=\"modern-programming\">Modern Programming</h3>\n<p>In the 20th century, programming became a well-developed science &mdash; a branch of theoretical mathematics. This led to the development of modern programming languages.</p>\n<p>There were several competing ideas about nature of computer programming and how languages should be structured. The \"winner\" turned out to be a set of ideas promoted by John von Neumann &mdash; ideas which included logical control structures like IF and LOOP.</p>\n<p>This so-called \"von Neumann architecture\" allowed for the advent of programming as we know it today, and the development of high-level computer programs. It has dominated the logic and structure of every major programming language since. Only a handful of non-von-Neumann languages (such Plankalk&uuml;l) exist, and none of them have gotten any widespread use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>1801</dt>\n<dd>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom\">Jaquard loom</a>, which uses punch cards to store weaving designs, is invented.

The first idea was that simple hardware should be controlled by complex instructions &mdash; that the \"program\" should be changeable without changing the hardware. The other idea was that computer programs should be broken down into small bits of conditionally executed code that could be jumped to from anywhere in the program. This allowed <code>IF</code>, <code>ELSE</code> and <code>LOOP</code> structures to be written into computer programs.</dd>\n</dl>\n<!-- IMAGE: John Non Neumann\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif\n-->\n<dl>\n<dt>1949</dt>\n<dd>Short Code, the first programming language, was developed, based on Von Neumann's ideas.

Quantum computing may lead to a whole new paradigm of computer programming; computers may learn to program themselves, leading to the Singularity and the end of the human era; we may discover how to use programming to mimic biological intelligence, leading to transhumanism. Or we might just figure out how to make our phones smaller.</p>\n<p>Whatever the future holds, it is more and clear that programming &mdash; being able to read and write code in a handful of common languages &mdash; is becoming the new business literacy. Familiarity with programming concepts and with the logic of computer systems and architecture is quickly becoming as important as basic business skills like sales, marketing, and design.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"more-resources\">Further Reading and Resources</h2>\n<p>More programming guides, tutorials, and infographics related to coding and developer resources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/computer-careers/\">Computer Careers</a>: job descriptions and resources for career paths in computer technology.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.whoishostingthis.com/compare/development/languages/\">Programming Languages and Web Development</a>: learn your options.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/2014/09/18/women-in-tech/\">Women Making Their Mark in Tech</a>: find out all about how women have affected and continue to affect tech in this infographic.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-code\">What Code Should You Learn?</h3>\n\n<p>Confused about what programming language you should learn to code in?
